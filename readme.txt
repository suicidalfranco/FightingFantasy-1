WELCOME TO FIGHTING FANTASY!

Authored by Alex Burt with ideas and concepts by Robert Caradain.

(Big shout out to @Barnacules for his #CodeGasm series on C# which gave me the motivation to start this project!)




Fighting Fantasy is a turn based RPG which will allow you to fight different monsters in an arena which will get
progressively more difficult as you level up.  By upgrading your equipment and becoming more experienced in your
profession, you will be able to tackle the more difficult monsters which reap greater rewards.
